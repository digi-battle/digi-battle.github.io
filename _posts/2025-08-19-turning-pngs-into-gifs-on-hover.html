<style>
    .text-center {
        text-align: center;
    }

    .my {
        margin: 3rem;
    }

    I saw this effect used a few years ago and I've been looking for a cool application for it ever since.
</p>

<p>
    It was on a musician's personal site (the link is now dead) - but the navigation links on the website were all painted images which were replaced by animated GIFs when hovered.
</p>

<p>
    My favourite was a Mazda Miata-style car that opened and flashed its headlights when you hovered over it.

    LIVE-EDIT: I found an archive of the site on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230511220618/https://atrpntime.net/art" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wayback machine</a>. This is the effect I'm talking about:
</p>

<div class="text-center my">
    <div class="gif-container" style="max-width: 200px;">
        <img src="/assets/img/blog/gif-hover/probey1.png" />
        <img src="/assets/img/blog/gif-hover/probey1.gif" />
    </div>
</div>

<p>
    I was so impressed when I first saw this, I've never seen anyone do this before and I think it's so cool and original.

    Mandatory Dr Pepper example:

<div class="text-center my">
    <div class="gif-container">
        <img src="/assets/img/blog/gif-hover/dr-pepper.png" />
        <img src="/assets/img/blog/gif-hover/dr-pepper.gif" />
    </div>
