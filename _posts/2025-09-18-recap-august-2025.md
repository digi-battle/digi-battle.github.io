## Intro
Welcome to the August 2025 recap, arriving well later than it should be. 

I plan to make this a new regular feature where I talk about the things I've been looking into for the past month. This will 1) allow me to share some cool stuff and 2) consolodate this cool stuff so that I can find it myself instead of trying to find the .txt file I saved a link to in 6 months time.

In August I read about traditional artists and started drawing again, found some cool graphic design tools, started learning Figma, began learning about typography and started playing the video game Psycho Patrol R. 

I also quit vaping, but more on that at a future date.

## Make Animated Gifs From Images
Found a cool site to generate animated gifs from images with loads of predefined animations and import tools - [3dgifmaker.com](https://www.3dgifmaker.com)

Rotating Digimon card I made with it in 2 seconds.

## Websites by bicflame
[bicflame](https://www.instagram.com/bicflame) is an artist/musician who's recently developed some cool Y2K inspired websites for [the band after](https://www.after.band/) and [his energy drink Zipp](https://zipp.rip/). I think they're pretty neat.

## GGBOTNET: Free Font Designer
While browsing fonts I discovered this guy [GGBOTNET](https://www.ggbot.net/), a game designer who makes free fonts. They've made over 100 fonts that are freely available under open licenses. 

I think it's very impressive that a single person has produced so much work and then allows everyone else to benefit from their efforts. One of their fonts was even used in an official [Ariana Grande lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG7w56PyTmU&list=PLZM8OwN06-LFv80BuVdPm-fZvMD8-0gAj&index=12).

Go check out their work on [itch.io](https://ggbot.itch.io/), they've also made [videos showing their font design process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIjVFHf2xFE&list=PLZM8OwN06-LFQi0mfhJblQeskucK-dCRt).


## Fit Font by David Jonathan Ross
Not only did I find a font that I really like, the webpage is **phenominal**. 

[Fit](https://djr.com/fit/) is a bold, in-your-face font designed to occupy as much available space as possible. The font is presented exceptionally well on [David Jonothan Ross' website](https://djr.com). The striking, imposing and authoritarian feel of the page reinforces what this font is all about.

*Chris Lewis* is credited with the design of the page but it looks like their website is expired so I won't link it here.

## HEX Projects Website
[HEX Projects](https://hex.xyz/) is a typographic company that makes fonts and websites. Their fonts are cool, but the website homepage is what really impressed me. 

I think the spacing, colours, use of type and how they present their work is all really fantastic. Lots of really neat CSS tricks on display too so plenty to learn by inspecting the source code.

## Comic Artist: R. Crumb
This month I went down a Robert Crumb-shaped rabbit hole from which I've emerged. Can't call myself a fan of him or the majority of his work, but I did find some things of his that I really enjoy. 

He illustrated the cover of *Cheap Thrills* by *Big Brother and the Holding Company*, the title text I like a lot.

A lot of his illustartions are notable but I particularly like this one.

If you're interested in him then I would recommend watching [Crumb (1994) on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2_SXKWa4mY), a documentary about the man, his work and his family - or visit his official website [crumbproducts.com](https://crumbproducts.com).
