## Intro
I spent this month neck-deep in Figma. I feel like it's now a tool I can actually use to get work done. It's satisfying being able to throw elements around and see what works without touching the development side of things.

Outside of Figma I've mostly been looking at fonts, found a few cool websites and took some pictures. 

[digi-battle.com](https://digi-battle.com/) hit 2 million page views and it's starting to get cold outside.

## Tech Stack Database: stackshare.io
See what tech stacks companies are using. [BBC website's stack](https://stackshare.io/bbc/bbc) as an example. Good to see what technology is actually in use. 


## "Your" vs "My" in user interfaces by Adam Silver
Blog post discussing the use of "Your" and "My" when referring to a user's own information in an interface. Go [read the post](https://adamsilver.io/blog/your-vs-my-in-user-interfaces/) and the [follow up](https://adamsilver.io/blog/my-response-to-hacker-news-comments/) written by Adam Silver.


## Marcy the Baptist: Website Text Transform
Neat type style here. Super simple web page that's just a list of links, but they've applied `transform: scaleY(3);` to everything to stretch the text out vertically. It's ugly, hard to read and scaling text rather than changing the font size is just bad - but I've never seen this done before and I think it's visually cool.

I should note that I don't know who this person is or what they do. [Their website](https://himerathreetimes.github.io/normal.html) has a lot of external links to stuff I haven't vetted - basically I'm not endorsing anything you find on there. Thinking I should put a disclaimer like this on all monthly recaps&hellip;

## *Cool Websites for 3D Artists* by KAMI EXP
Watched this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfcR6g1sfQ0) by [KAMI EXP](https://kamiexp.com) and found out about some cool websites:
- [cari.institute/aesthetics](https://cari.institute/aesthetics) - Visual catalog of different styles of design
- [screamingbrainstudios.com](https://screamingbrainstudios.com/) - Old school graphics library under the public domain.
- [gifcities.org](https://gifcities.org) - The Geocities Animated Gif Search from Internet Archive.
- [Effect Texture Maker](https://mebiusbox.github.io/contents/EffectTextureMaker/) - Generator for 3D textures with options to animate. 

Quick GIF made with the effect texture maker.

## Font Catalog: uncut.wtf
[uncut.wtf](https://uncut.wtf/) is a simple font/type database with a cool design.

## Website Builder for Artists: cargo.site
Discovered [cargo.site](https://cargo.site/) recently, surprised I've not heard of this before. It's a website builder and web host aimed at people in creative industries. They have a number of really cool templates on offer with a lot of design elements that I've never seen before. 

You should check out [the sites that use them](https://cargo.site/company-writing/sites-in-use) or their [company writing (blog)](https://cargo.site/company-writing).

Found a number of other cool sites because of cargo&hellip;


## Type Design Studio: Dinamo Typefaces
[Dinamo Typefaces](https://abcdinamo.com/) is a typeface design studio with a cool website. Found them by browsing the source code of some [cargo.site](https://cargo.site/) websites that use their fonts.


## Website: umru.dj
[umru.dj](https://umru.dj/) is the personal site of the musical artist umru. The site was built with [cargo.site](https://cargo.site/).

Screenshots really don't do it justice so I suggest checking it out, it's a one-pager. 

![umru.dj homepage](/assets/img/blog/recap-sep-2025/umru.dj.png)


## Website: parentcompa.nyc
[PARENT COMPANY](https://parentcompa.nyc/) is a design firm that's worked with umru (or is owned by/operated by? I don't know). Their website is cool. The umru.dj site says it was build with a PARENT COMPANY site builder but the source code references cargo a lot.

Another site that's worth a visit rather than looking at screenshots.

## I got a film camera
My girlfriend got me an old film camera so I've been having some fun learning to use it. Had to wait a while to identify and order missing parts from eBay, but eventually got a roll of film loaded. 

It's a different experience not being able to immediately see what you've captured. It makes me not care too much about trying because I have no idea if what I'm doing is what I think is good.

As expected most of the roll was spent trying to figure out how the camera works but I did get a couple of nice ones. Here's my favorite.
