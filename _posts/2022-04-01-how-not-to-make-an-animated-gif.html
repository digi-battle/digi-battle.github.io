    <div class="flex-container">
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/dr-pepper.gif" class="can" alt="A can of Dr Pepper that's rotation is infinite, like my love for Dr Pepper." />
    </div>
    <div class="container center">
        <p>This is a rotating can of Dr Pepper.</p>

        <p>One day I was looking at a non-rotating can of Dr Pepper and thought to myself; &quot;It sure would be great if this would rotate&quot;. Then I realised I needed a hobby, but decided instead to teach myself how to make an animated GIF.</p>

        <p>The plan was to take pictures of the can rotating then remove the background using a green screen by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chroma keying</a>. This would create a stop-motion animation effect. Here is one of the original stills from this.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/green-screen.jpg" class="center" />

        <p>Unfortunately this caused an unforeseen issue where the green screen was visible in the reflections on the can, which didn't look good.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/green-can.gif" class="center" style="max-height: 200px;" />

        <p>So I re-shot all the frames but with a white background. </p>
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/white-screen.jpg" class="center" />

        <p>The images were then imported into Sony Vegas as an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFaFl132VNs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">image sequence.</a></p>
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/image-sequence.jpg" class="center" />

        <p>Thankfully because the subject of the animation never changes shape, I could isolate it using a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efV4P3qBI5M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mask.</a></p>
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/mask.jpg" class="center" />

        <p>The last thing I did in Sony Vegas was render the video as an image sequence.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/render.jpg" class="center" />

        <p>Which gave me a nice folder of alpha channelled PNGs of the Dr Pepper can.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/alpha-cans.jpg" class="center" />

        <p>All that was left to do was compile the images into an animated GIF. I did this using GIMP. The steps to do this are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>File > New</li>
            <li>Enter the dimensions of one of the images</li>
            <li>File > Open as Layers > Select your folder with the frames</li>
            <li>Delete the Background layer</li>
            <li>Image > Crop to Content</li>
            <li>(At this point you can resize the image if you like)</li>
            <li>File > Export As</li>
            <li>Put .gif at the end of the file name and you'll see the GIF export window</li>
            <li>Click Export</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are the GIF export settings that I used.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/work/dr-pepper/gif-export.jpg" class="center" />

        <p>And that's it. Did I know what I was doing? Kind of. Is there a better way of achieveing this? Definitely. Do I now have a beautiful rotating Dr Pepper can to enjoy? Absolutely.</p>

        <a href="#" class="center" style="text-align: center; padding: 20px;">go see the can again</a>
    </div>
</body>
